# Jzignata

This is a Zig port of [`jsonata`](https://github.com/jsonata-js/jsonata) for the sake of me learning Zig, but also because I'm interested in how a dedicated Zig implementation of `jsonata` would perform compared with others (like the original javascript or [the golang version](https://github.com/yxuco/gojsonata)).

I've copied the test cases from [the original repo](https://github.com/jsonata-js/jsonata/tree/master/test) and plan to implement against this spec.
