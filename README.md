# Jzignata

This is a port of `jsonata` to `zig`, for the sake of me learning zig, but also because I'm interested in how a dedicated `zig` implementation of `jsonata` would perform compared to others.

I've copied the test cases from [the original repo](https://github.com/jsonata-js/jsonata/tree/master/test) and plan to implement against this spec.
